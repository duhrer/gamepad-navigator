# Privacy Policy

The Gamepad Navigator allows the user to navigate Chromium-based browsers and web pages using a game controller. It
provides various features that allow navigation using gamepad such as web page scrolling, tab navigation, click on
buttons and hyperlinks, et cetera. Due to the nature of browser and web page navigation, the Gamepad Navigator requires
permission to interact with the content in active web pages, browser windows, and tabs.

## Information the Gamepad Navigator collects

The Gamepad Navigator makes use of user preferences entered using the extension configuration panel, which can be
removed/deleted using panel buttons. To enable navigation features, the content of active websites is also parsed.

## How the Gamepad Navigator uses the information

User preferences are used to determine which gamepad inputs activate browser actions. Page content is parsed to
determine which focusable elements are available, so that the user can navigate between focusable elements as they would
with the tab key on a keyboard.

## What information does the Gamepad Navigator share

User preferences entered are stored locally on the user's computer and not shared with any site. Page content used for
navigation is only retained temporarily in memory, and is not shared with any site.
